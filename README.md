Row with the Highest Number of Parked Cars:

This Python project calculates the row with the highest number of parked cars in a given parking lot. The parking lot is represented as a 2D matrix (list of lists), where each cell contains the number of cars parked in that particular spot. The user inputs the dimensions of the matrix and the number of cars in each spot, and the program identifies the row with the highest sum of parked cars.
